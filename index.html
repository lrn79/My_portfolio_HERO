            <p>I specialize in creating web-sites for individuals and businesses. You shouldn’t have to settle for
                cheap solutions or generic templates. I provide custom designs at afforable prices., so make sure it’s a
                good one. Since my time is split between a few different things, I’m not able to take on every project
                I’d like to, but I'm always looking for fun work. Take a look at my portfolio below</p>
